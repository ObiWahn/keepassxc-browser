Firefox caches KeePassXC-Browser files
======================================
Find either a workaround or solution to stop Firefox from caching parts of the
extension after upgrades. To reproduce:
  1. Open KeePassXC-Browser settings
  2. Quit Firefox
  3. Upgrade web extension
  4. Start Firefox
  5. Go to KeePassXC-Browser settings
=> Still shows previous version of KeePassXC-Browser
Current ugly workaround: rm -rf $HOME/.cache/mozilla/

Switch to Built-Using
=====================
It is not perfect, but still better to replace the manually gathered code copies
above by copies from existing Debian packages and indicate them by the
Built-Using field in debian/control.

Candidates:
  - TweetNacl (node-tweetnacl)
  - Bootstrap (libjs-bootstrap4)
  - jQuery (libjs-jquery)
